## Building and Deploying a CNN


![image](raw/latest/scratch/domino-nvidia-aws.png)

1. Train a CNN model using a Tesla V100 GPU and a Domino environment preconfigured with an NVIDIA driver, CUDA 9, Tensorflow, and Keras. 

    * Use this notebook to train and save the model: [MNIST_keras.ipynb](view/MNIST_keras.ipynb)
    


2. Use Domino to deploy and manage a model API Endpoint on AWS. 

    * Use this file as when building the API: [MNIST_predict_list.py](view/MNIST_predict_list.py)
    


3. Use Domino to deploy and manage a Web App on AWS allowing others to interact with your model.

    * Use these files to define the web app: [ui.R](view/ui.R) and [server.R](view/server.R)
